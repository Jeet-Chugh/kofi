### Game Concept Overview  
This collaborative-competitive storytelling experience features two players co-creating a narrative driven by specialized AI systems. The game blends creative writing with objective-based competition, culminating in AI-generated video summaries. Key components include:

1. **Narrative Foundation**  
   - **Narrator AI**: Establishes initial setting, characters, and context (e.g., "Cyberpunk marketplace where rival hackers clash over a data crystal")  
   - **Objective AI**: Generates two mutually exclusive goals from the narrator's setup (e.g., "Steal the prototype" vs. "Destroy the prototype")  

2. **Player Interaction**  
   - **Turn-based storytelling**: Players alternate writing 50-word actions (1 sentence max)  
   - **Pace slider**: Controls narrative impact (1=subtle detail, 5=major plot twist)  
   - **Moderator AI**: Validates inputs for:  
     - Make sure the input does not override the environment of the story
     - Make sure the input does not deviate from the previous story context by too much

3. **Game Resolution**  
   - **Judge AI**: Analyzes full story transcript to:  
     - Declare winning objective  
   - **Scribe AI**: Generates 15-30 second Veo3 video summary
